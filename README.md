## <span lang="la">Hora Solis</span> ‚Äì a Roman clock dividing day and night into temporal hours

**[<span lang="la">Hora Solis</span>](https://horasolis.github.io/)** is a digital reinterpretation of ancient [Roman timekeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_timekeeping) ‚Äî a system that aligns the day not with factory clocks or timezones, but with the movement of the sun across the sky.

Unlike modern timekeeping, which divides every day into 24 identical hours regardless of season or place, the Roman system divides *daylight* into twelve equal hours (*<span lang="la">horae</span>*) and *night* into four watches (*<span lang="la">vigiliae</span>*). The length of these hours shifts with the seasons ‚Äî shorter in winter, longer in summer ‚Äî because the sun sets the pace.

This project presents Roman time in a visual, intuitive form. It doesn‚Äôt just tell you the hour ‚Äî it shows how the shape of the day is changing around you.

## Why this matters

Modern time exists to synchronize us. Timezones, standardized hours, and daylight saving are tools of industry ‚Äî designed for factories, offices, and global schedules. They reduce time to something fixed and mechanical: a uniform rhythm imposed everywhere, detached from place, light, and season.

But natural time isn‚Äôt uniform. The sun doesn‚Äôt rise at 6:00 every day. Days lengthen and shorten, light shifts, and with it, our sense of being changes ‚Äî even if the clock doesn‚Äôt reflect it.

Roman timekeeping invites us to see time differently: not as a grid to obey, but as a rhythm woven into the fabric of life. It expands and contracts with the sun, flows with the day, and settles into the night. It restores a deeper awareness of time ‚Äî not as something measured, but as something lived.

You may find yourself planning your day differently ‚Äî setting aside the evening *<span lang="la">vigiliae</span>* for quiet work, time with family, reading, or creative focus. If you follow a biphasic sleep rhythm, you might align your shorter rest with midday or early night, letting the first hours of darkness become a calm, intentional space. Or perhaps you‚Äôll discover the quiet clarity of early morning, just as the world begins to wake.

May this project help you rediscover your own rhythm.

## What the interface displays

[See the live page](https://horasolis.github.io/).

The following reflects the Roman system of daily time:

* **<span lang="la">Tempus üåû diurnum / Tempus üåö nocturnum</span>**  
  A two-column display of day and night temporal hours.

* **Daytime hours ‚Ö†‚Äì‚Ö´**  
  The twelve daytime hours measured from sunrise to sunset.

* **Night watches (<span lang="la">vigilia prima ‚Üí vigilia quarta</span>)**  
  The night divided into four watches, each spanning three nighttime hours.

* **<span lang="la">Tempus somni</span>**  
  A suggested sleep period timed to support waking at sunrise.

* **<span lang="la">Longitudo üåû diei et üåö noctis</span>**  
  The duration of day and night, varying with the seasons.

* **<span lang="la">Dies civilis üèõÔ∏è</span>**  
  The civil time and date in modern notation.

* **<span lang="la">Ortus solis üåÖ / Occasus solis üåá</span>**  
  Sunrise and sunset times for the current day.

* **<span lang="la">Tempus ad somnum capiendum üõèÔ∏è</span>**  
  Recommended bedtime for rising with the sun.

* **<span lang="la">Ortus solis die sequenti ‚è≠Ô∏èüåÖ</span>**  
  Time of tomorrow‚Äôs sunrise.

* **<span lang="la">Cursus horologii üêá/üêå</span>**  
  The pace of the clock, reflecting seasonal shifts in hour length.

## Supporting Hora Solis and future projects

If you find this project helpful, share it with others who might like it ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs chatting with friends or posting about it on social media. Every little mention helps it reach someone who might appreciate it.

## Future roadmap

These are some directions the project may take moving forward:

1. **Sleep configuration and multi-phase sleep**  
   Customizable sleep schedules, including support for segmented and other polyphasic sleep patterns.

2. **Adjustable solar event angles**  
   More precise control over when sunrise and sunset are considered to occur, by setting how far the sun is below the horizon.

3. **Task planning**  
   Ways to organize the day around natural light and solar rhythms.

4. **Calendar integration**  
   Syncing with external calendar services to keep everything aligned.

Bringing these ideas to life will take time and effort. Whether or not they happen depends on how much interest the project receives. Donations are one way to show support and help shape what comes next.

### Sun azimuth

The sun‚Äôs azimuth is the compass direction from which sunlight is coming at a given point on Earth‚Äôs surface.
It is typically defined as the angle between the sun‚Äôs position and true north, measured clockwise:

* 0¬∞ = North
* 90¬∞ = East
* 180¬∞ = South
* 270¬∞ = West
* 360¬∞ = North (completing the circle)
