## Hora Solis – a Roman clock of the natural day

**[Hora Solis](https://horasolis.github.io)** is a digital reinterpretation of ancient Roman timekeeping — a system that aligns the day not with factory clocks or timezones, but with the movement of the sun across the sky.

Unlike modern timekeeping, which divides every day into 24 identical hours regardless of season or place, the Roman system divides *daylight* into twelve equal hours (*horae*) and *night* into four watches (*vigiliae*). The length of these hours shifts with the seasons — shorter in winter, longer in summer — because the sun sets the pace.

This project presents Roman time in a visual, intuitive form. It doesn’t just tell you the hour — it shows how the shape of the day is changing around you.

## Why this matters

Modern time exists to synchronize us. Timezones, standardized hours, and daylight saving are tools of industry — designed for factories, offices, and global schedules. They reduce time to something fixed and mechanical: a uniform rhythm imposed everywhere, detached from place, light, and season.

But natural time isn’t uniform. The sun doesn’t rise at 6:00 every day. Days lengthen and shorten, light shifts, and with it, our sense of being changes — even if the clock doesn’t reflect it.

Roman timekeeping invites us to see time differently: not as a grid to obey, but as a rhythm woven into the fabric of life. It expands and contracts with the sun, flows with the day, and settles into the night. It restores a deeper awareness of time — not as something measured, but as something lived.

You may find yourself planning your day differently — setting aside the evening *vigiliae* for quiet work, time with family, reading, or creative focus. If you follow a biphasic sleep rhythm, you might align your shorter rest with midday or early night, letting the first hours of darkness become a calm, intentional space. Or perhaps you’ll discover the quiet clarity of early morning, just as the world begins to wake.

May this project help you rediscover your own rhythm.

## What the interface displays

[See the live page](https://horasolis.github.io).

The following reflects the Roman system of daily time:

* **Tempus 🌞 diei / Tempus 🌚 noctis** – The current phase of the day: daytime or nighttime.

* **Roman hours Ⅰ–Ⅻ** – Twelve daylight hours (from sunrise to sunset).

* **Night watches (vigilia prima to vigilia quarta)** – Dividing the night into four parts, each with three segments.

* **Tempus somni** – Suggested sleep period calculated to allow waking at sunrise.

* **Diu et nox duratio** – Length of day and night, which shift with the seasons.

* **Dies civilis 🏛️** – The civil date and time, in modern notation.

* **Ortus solis 🌅 / Occasus solis 🌇** – Today's sunrise and sunset times.

* **Ortus solis diei sequentis ⏭️🌅** – Tomorrow's sunrise, giving you a preview of the next cycle.

* **Tempus ad somnum quaerendum 🛏️** – Recommended bedtime for waking with the sun.

* **Cursus horologii 🐇/🐌** – Clock speed, which reflects changes in hour length.

### Sun azimuth

The sun's azimuth is the compass direction from which sunlight is coming at a given point on Earth's surface.
It is typically defined as the angle between the sun's position and true north, measured clockwise:

* 0° = North
* 90° = East
* 180° = South
* 270° = West
* 360° = North (completing the circle)
